# Bitmasking Demo

This example demonstrates the utility of bitmasking via simple permissions routines.  However, 
it can easily be adapted for use in any situation where flags/switches could be beneficial.  
PHP uses bitmasking to control [error reporting](http://jp2.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting), 
for example.
